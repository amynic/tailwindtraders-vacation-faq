Q: My manager has changed but they still receive my vacation requests. What do I need to do?

A: You need to check on your default approver settings. Go to https://ttvacation -> User Profile. Check the name of your default approver; and if it still shows your old manager, manually change it to your new manager via “Change”. This will ensure that requests are routed to the new manager for approval from now on.

 

Q: How can I stop my former manager from being on cc of my vacation request notifications?

A: You need to check your granted WOB privileges. Go to https://ttvacation -> User Profile. Check that your old manager is no longer set up as WOB for you - if they are still showing, manually remove your old manager from the WOB list by checking the box in front of your old manager's name and then clicking on the “Remove” button showing underneath the WOB list. This will ensure that the old manager is no longer cc'd on any notifications sent by Tailwind Traders Vacation to you.

 

Q: The new vacation year has started but my carry-forward days aren’t showing yet in the New Year – what do I have to do?

A: Your local Tailwind Traders Vacation administrator needs to execute the vacation year-end rollover process in the admin module of the tool first. This will ensure that the carry-forward days are transferred from the old year to the new vacation year. If in doubt, please contact your local Tailwind Traders Vacation administrator (as displayed under ‘Local Settings’ on https://ttvacation).

 

Q: How can I set up someone else with WOB privileges so to ensure someone else can request vacation for me in my absence?

A: Go to https://ttvacation -> User Profile. Add the respective person with “User” privilege only.

*Note: If you are a manager you will find in the respective drop-down “Manager” privilege also. Make sure you only select “User” privilege, if you do not want this other person to be able to approve/reject all the vacation requests sent to you, run reports on your team etc. besides requesting vacation for you.*

Q: As a manager how could I set up my Admin Assistant with WOB privilege for myself, enabling them to not only request vacation for myself but also to run reports on my team and approve/reject vacation requests of my employees.

A: Go to https://ttvacation -> User Profile. Add the respective person with “Manager” privilege.
*Note: If you are granting “Manager” privilege to your Admin Assistant she/he is able to act completely the same way as you could in Tailwind Traders Vacation. So make sure this is really what you intend to do.*
